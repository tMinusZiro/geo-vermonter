# Geo Vermonter

# Tech:

- web layout and UI with React
- embedding maps APIs
- geocoding APIs
- Passing props and setting State in React

# Game Rules:

- before the game begins the user should see a map of Vermont zoomed out just enough to view the whole state (zoom level ~8 on a map with a 600px height)
- when the player starts a game, they are dropped into a random spot inside Vermont
- the initial score is 100
- the zoom level is 18 and there are no streets or markers, only satellite imagery
- the map does **not** support zoom out, or slippy click-and-drag-to-move -- all movements must be deliberate, by clicking one of the north / south / east / west movement buttons
- every time the user clicks a movement button, the map moves a fixed amount in that direction, and the score is decreased by 1
- when the player clicks "Guess!" they can choose a county from a popup menu
- if the guess is correct then:
  - the game displays "You win!"
  - their final score is logged [how?]
  - the Info box is filled in with the correct latitude and longitude

> How do we get the nested list of Vermont towns and counties?

## Basic Layout

- Sketch out wireframes for a page with the following page elements.

| Selector                             | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `map`                                | shows the current map (initally the entire state of Vermont)                                       |
| `nav`                                | top of page, placeholder for "about" and "high scores" and such                                    |
| `info`                               | contains fields for...                                                                             |
| `latitude`, `long`, `county`, `town` | read-only text fields                                                                              |
| `north`, `south`, `east`, `west`     | buttons for movement                                                                               |
| `start`, `guess`, `quit`             | buttons labeled "Start a Game", "Guess the Spot", "I Give Up!" respectively - all disabled for now |
| `score`                              | text field                                                                                         |

- Then code the layout in React with placeholder information
- Run the React server with the command `npm start` to see your application

## State of the State

Using [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) a map of the state of Vermont has been created using the [Isri.WorldImagery tileset](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/).

The map should be at a _fixed_ zoom level (8 is pretty good for a map that's 600px high), enough to show just the boundaries of the state and not much more.

The boundaries of Vermont are specified in the `border.js` file

# Stories

## Game On

**Given** a page with a map, Start, Quit, and Guess buttons

**When** the user clicks _Start a Game_

**Then** the Start button is disabled

**And** the Guess button is enabled

**And** the Quit button is enabled

## Random Spot

**Given** the game has not been started

**When** the user clicks _Start a Game_

**Then** the app chooses a random lat/long position _inside the boundaries of Vermont_

- [leaflet-pip](https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-pip) is a library for finding out whether a point is inside a polygon

**And** zooms and centers the map to that location, with a _different fixed zoom level_ of 18

**And** displays question marks inside the lat, long, county, and town fields

> optionally: it displays a small map of Vermont counties on the side, e.g. https://geology.com/county-map/vermont-county-map.gif

## I Give Up!

**Given** the game has been started

**When** the user clicks the "I Give Up" button

**Then** the app displays the lat/long position inside the `info` panel

**And** uses _geocoding_ to look up the town and county, and displays those inside the `info` panel

## Guess the County

**Given** the game has been started

**When** the user clicks the Guess button

**Then** the user sees a _modal dialog box_ asking "What county are we in?" with a [popup list of all Vermont counties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Vermont)

**And** two buttons ("Guess" and "Cancel")

<hr/>

**When** the user selects the correct county and clicks "Guess"

**Then** the game _fills in_ that county name in the Info box (instead of a question mark) (as well as the other geocoded information)

**And** informs the user "Correct!"

<hr/>

**When** the user selects an incorrect county

**Then** The game _subtracts_ 10 from score

**And** informs the user "Wrong!"

**And** the dialog box disappears

<hr/>

**When** the user clicks "Cancel"

**Then** the dialog box disappears with no change to score

## Move

**Given** the game has been started

**When** the user clicks the "North" button

**Then** the map scrolls a fixed distance to the north (~.002 degrees lat or long should be a good distance)

**And** the score is reduced by 1 point

> and likewise for East, South, and West buttons

## Return

**Given** the user has started the game

**And** moved from their initial location

**When** the user clicks the "Return" button

**Then** the game scrolls back to the starting spot, with no change in score

## Breadcrumbs

**When** the user clicks a movement button

**Then** the map draws a dotted line between the previous map center and the new map center

**And** keeps showing the dotted line during the rest of game

# Icebox

## Save Score (local)

**When** the user wins a game

**Then** the game asks the user for their name (or remembers from earlier)

**And** saves the name and score to a list of games

<hr/>

**When** the user selects "high scores" from the nav bar

**Then** the app shows a list of all games, in score order (top to bottom)

> For the first pass, use [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) so it persists across game sessions. **BEWARE** that the values can only be strings, so you must use `JSON.stringify` on the way in and `JSON.parse` on the way out.

## Previous Games:

**Given** the game is over

**When** the game is saved, don't just save the name and score: all the info, including spot and all moves taken, and any guesses, should be saved as well

**Then** viewing old games, the user can select one and see the above info

## View Replay

**Given** the user is viewing previous games

**When** the user selects 'view replay' on a game

**Then** the game shows a replay at a speed of 1 move per second

## Challenge Mode

- Guess the town, not the county
- Daily Challenge - every user uses the same point
- Burlington Challenge - guess the neighborhood
